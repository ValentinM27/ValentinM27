Hello there! 

👋 I'm Valentin, a passionate French web developer creating digital solutions at Atol Conseils et Développements. With a focus on agriculture and agronomy projects, I blend my expertise in JavaScript and TypeScript to cultivate innovative web experiences.

🌱 My toolkit includes Vue.js, my primary choice for crafting seamless user interfaces. I'm also well-versed in React-based tools like Next.js, expanding my horizons for versatile development.

⚙️ On the backend frontier, I wield the power of Node.js and navigate the Laravel landscape. These tools allow me to cultivate robust and efficient server-side functionalities.

🐳 I'm not only fascinated by coding but also by the intricate dance of CI/CD with Docker. My understanding of pipelines helps me orchestrate smooth sailing from development to deployment.

🚀 If you're seeking a collaborative spirit to enhance your open-source endeavors, I'm here to connect. Let's embark on a journey to elevate projects to new heights. Feel free to reach out for a chat or to join forces on an exciting venture.
